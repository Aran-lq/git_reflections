q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than a local one?
   it' obvious when I want to share my project and cooperate with others, or maybe I haven't my own laptop at hand.
q: why you hope always pull or push change commit by your own hand rather than auto?
	because when I have put a commit, I just don't think it's a complete function and maybe it's not suitable enough to share. if autosync by github, maybe other will visit a uncompetentable version that I havn't improve. So sync by my own is better.
