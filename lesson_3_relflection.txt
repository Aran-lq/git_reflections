q1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than a local one?
   it' obvious when I want to share my project and cooperate with others, or maybe I haven't my own laptop at hand.

q2: why you hope always pull or push change commit by your own hand rather than auto?
	because when I have put a commit, I just don't think it's a complete function and maybe it's not suitable enough to share. if autosync by github, maybe other will visit a uncompetentable version that I havn't improve. So sync by my own is better.

q3: please tell the different between Fork, clone, branch. 
	1. fork is a copy operation from other repository to your account on github, Which has a URL link to the source repository. You can clone it to local and change it, commit it, update it for making a your own version. But you can't 
	2. clone is a operation making a repository copy from github to local, local to local, or github to github.
	3. branch is a label which can locate your commit. It's a important part in your repository, can easily do the parrellel develop and some experimental attempt.

q4: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote branch (stored locally)?
	1. I can easily check the change when I'm in a place without internet access.
	2. it can remind me whether I have a sync problem between local and github when using git status or something like that.
